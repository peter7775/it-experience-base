### Creating your Own Makers

In case your applications need to generate custom boilerplate code, you can create your own make:... command reusing the tools provided by this bundle. To do that, you should create a class that extends AbstractMaker in your src/Maker/ directory. And this is really it!

For examples of how to complete your new maker command, see the core maker commands. Make sure your class is registered as a service and tagged with maker.command. If youâ€™re using the standard Symfony services.yaml configuration, this will be done automatically.
